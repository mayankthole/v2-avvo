Before contacting their office, two immigration attorneys informed me that I had no chance of becoming a U.S. citizen. I had a run-in with the law when I was younger and made mistakes that made th e process extremely difficult. With a record on file, the path to citizenship seemed nearly impossible. However, Ballout Law conducted a thorough and honest evaluation of my case and assured me that I still had a viable path forward. Through their expertise, professionalism, and dedication, my application was approved, and I am now a United States citizen. I would also like to recognize the entire staff at Ballout Law for their outstanding customer service. They were consistently professional, attentive, and supportive, and they went above and beyond to ensure I was informed and comfortable throughout the process. I also want to share this message: for anyone who has had a run-in with the law in the past, it is still possible to become a United States citizen. If you stay on the right path, stay out of trouble, and continue being a good and responsible person, there is hope. Ballout Law is proof that the right representation can make all the difference. I highly recommend Ballout Law to anyone seeking knowledgeable and reliable immigration representation.",Hired Attorney,This review is from a person who hired this attorney.,,,

Their consistency and professionalism stood out. When we finally reached the hearing, Negin’s courtroom skill was remarkable. Her cross-examination was precise and powerful, dismantling the opposing side’s claims within minutes. The judge ruled in our favor on the spot. Negin didn’t just win a case — she restored my faith in the justice system. She is strategic, compassionate, and delivers results through preparation and integrity. If you’re facing false accusations or any legal challenge that tests your character, I highly recommend Attorney Negin Yamini.",Hired Attorney,This review is from a person who hired this attorney.,,,

Additionally, Negin coordinated closely with my criminal defense attorney, who repeatedly expressed how impressed he was with her, even asking me, ""How did you find her?"" Thanks to Negin's sharp intelligence, attention to detail, and professionalism, I've been able to keep my license, my job, and my professional dignity.

From the very beginning, Negin brought a rare combination of legal precision, courtroom poise, and deep empathy to my case. This was a complex matter involving multiple hearings, challenging evidence, and high stakes — but Negin navigated it all with extraordinary care. She believed in my case, gave it the attention it deserved, and ultimately won a permanent restraining order (PRO) that validated my experience and protected my safety. What sets Negin apart is not just her legal skill — which is top-tier — but her deep understanding of trauma-informed advocacy. Her confidence and thorough preparation gave me peace of mind during one of the most difficult periods of my life. I am deeply grateful for her representation and would recommend her without hesitation to anyone seeking a restraining order.

After conducting thorough research by calling several offices and talking with different attorneys, I finally decided to hire Negin. I am so grateful that I did! Negin immediately began working on my case, demonstrating expertise in understanding my licensing board and how to strategically negotiate my hearings on my behalf. Negin and her office staff were excellent communicators, keeping me informed about each step of the process. Their clear communication truly eased my worries, and every penny spent was worth it. Additionally, Negin coordinated closely with my criminal defense attorney, who repeatedly expressed how impressed he was with her, even asking me, ""How did you find her?"" Thanks to Negin's sharp intelligence, attention to detail, and professionalism, I've been able to keep my license, my job, and my professional dignity. Thanks to her, I achieved my desired outcome—no more anxiety or sleepless nights. I highly recommend running, not walking, to trust Negin to represent you. Best of luck!

She helped defend me from a vicious landlord’s slanderous, fraudulent, and vindictive attack on me because I was a whistleblower about the landlord’s illegal actions concerning tenants. Negin was confident, smart, calm, tough and very knowledgeable about how the c ourt system works concerning civil restraining orders. I have never been in a legal situation before of this kind and it was very stressful due to the possible consequences of a granted restraining order. During the hearing before the commissioner/judge, Negin’s precise and tactical cross examination of the landlord was perfectly executed. Her pinpoint questions exposed the landlord’s pathological lying to the judge. Negin was able to blow open the obvious holes in the landlord’s blatant lies and fraudulent “evidence” because of her intelligent questions. Negin’s staff was also very helpful. Negin always answers her phone or responds with a text within minutes. That’s a very good trait for an attorney-client relationship.

She helped defend me from a vicious landlord’s slanderous, fraudulent, and vindictive attack on me because I was a whistleblower about the landlord’s illegal actions concerning tenants. Negin was confident, smart, calm, tough and very knowledgeable about how the c ourt system works concerning civil restraining orders. I have never been in a legal situation before of this kind and it was very stressful due to the possible consequences of a granted restraining order. During the hearing before the commissioner/judge, Negin’s precise and tactical cross examination of the landlord was perfectly executed. Her pinpoint questions exposed the landlord’s pathological lying to the judge. Negin was able to blow open the obvious holes in the landlord’s blatant lies and fraudulent “evidence” because of her intelligent questions. Negin’s staff was also very helpful. Negin always answers her phone or responds with a text within minutes. That’s a very good trait for an attorney-client relationship. I highly recommend Negin Yamini and her staff if you need legal help.",Hired Attorney,This review is from a person who hired this attorney.,,,

She reassured us when we felt doubtful about our case due to the plaintiff's false accusations against my husband .

Negin replied to every not so good comment/review with a sincere and honest explanation. The other firms did not reply to their negative reviews or comments. Her responses demonstrated a level of caring that no other law firm on AVVO had. Also, several reviews mentioned how very responsive, caring and personable she is. I sent her an email and within an hour received a text message direct from Nagin with an appointment to discuss my case. Throughout my entire legal proceeding, Negin and her staff were professional, always available to take my calls and offer support in any way possible.

Negin Yamini and her legal team met every expectation and excelled at lead ing the preparations for a defense that would expose the truth and preserve my sense of justice and peace of mind. The very first conversation with Ms Yamini was an immediate confirmation that she was the right lawyer for me and my case. I had interviewed a number of other attorneys, and none of them could provide me with the confidence and compassion to my unique cases as she did. Her legal assistants were all very thoughtful, skillful and kind. Everyone worked diligently to prepare for my criminal case. The most important factor I felt Negin imparted was that there was hope and that she in her years of law practice absolutely believed this case was defendable. She explained A to Z in the legal processes and was helpful beyond words in guiding me through the work and documents that I needed to draft and provide. Communication was critical for me to feel like my needs were getting the attention they deserved. All of my texts and calls were responded to in a quick manner. I never felt like my case had been deprioritized or that her fee wasn't reasonable for the service I was receiving. As we prepared a strong and extremely detailed mitigation package, I felt confident too, that this would all work out for the better. Fortunately, the DA filling agent rejected the case based on the lack of credibility of the accuser. Since I can not attest to Ms Yamin's skills in the courtroom, I will only say that working with her initially was highly mentionable in a review. I would recommend her to family and friends, and will continue to work with her and her team in the future should I need her counsel. I also wanted to mention that as I was searching for an attorney, I came across another review that wasn’t as favorable, and as a critically thinking adult I read through it carefully and was able to see that it was someone's experience, but was also overly exaggerated, based on the persons clear objective to tarnish a professionals reputation. Interesting that I came to her with a similar situation, although it wasn’t just a review, it was a criminal charge. I think in a world where the internet will post and magnify content that individuals can spread without concern or a sense of personal accountability, reviews have to be taken with a grain of salt. I am absolutely impressed and beyond satisfied with Ms. Yamini's professionalism, her personal relatability, her knowledge and most importantly her strength to fight for her clients.

With poise and determination, she navigated the complexities of my case, engaging with the board with a perfect blend of assertiveness and diplomacy.

I hired her after letting my previous attorney go because it literally took me weeks just to get a hold of him. Negin was always prompt and diligent in getting back to me and relaying all the progress of my case. She also set aside good amount of time for us to meet go over the case and do whatever was needed to win. During the case she was very vigorous eager and zealous while arguing my defense. I've dealt with many attorneys in my life but never seen an attorney that was always on top of things and did her best efforts to help me in a genuinely way. I highly recommend her you won't go wrong!,Hired Attorney,This review is from a person who hired this attorney.,,,
